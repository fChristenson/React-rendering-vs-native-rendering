# React rendering vs native rendering

## What we will cover

* We will look at a few examples of rendering
* We will reason about the results

## Notes

Since React became a thing I have found a lot of attention being
payed to the speed of the framework but I love it for another reason.

I never cared about the "speed" as I argued that the problem React solves
has nothing to do with the speed at which it renders, 
"if speed is what I want I go native" I thought to myself.

The problem with native Javascript is that it is hard to make big applications
scale over time and let's not even talk about maintaining the project...

React allows for a structured way to create projects that will be easier
for most people to work with, this is the same benefit you will get from
a lot of frameworks and languages such as Java.
